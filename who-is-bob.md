# Who is Bob?

For the purposes of this book, we shall be following the life of Bob, a fictional character who is on a quest to learn this tool.

Bob learnt about this tool whilst attending an IT conference where one of the presenters was using the tool to demonstrate how an avid computer user that uses the terminal regularly can improve their workflow - system administrators, computer security specialists, data scientists, software developers, or even the average hobbyist.
