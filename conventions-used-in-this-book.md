# Conventions used in this book

I'll use the following conventions throughout the book

| Convention     |                                                                              Definition                                                                              |
| -------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| **Ctrl + b**   |                                                            Hold the Control and 'b' keys at the same time.                                                           |
| **Ctrl + b %** | Hold the Control and 'b' keys at the same time, release and press the '%' key. \[Note that you may have to press "Shift" to access the "%" symbol on some keyboards. |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Keys are case-sensitive and may need you to press the "Shift" key to access capitalized characters, for example "Ctrl + b" is different from "Ctrl + B".&#x20;
{% endhint %}
