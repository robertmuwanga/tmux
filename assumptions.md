# Assumptions

Throughout this book I shall be using **Linux**. However, this tool is compatible with Apple Macintosh, Windows 10/11 with Bash Support, and Unix / BSD operating systems.

We shall be using **tmux Version 3** and I encourage you to use the latest version from the tmux homepage [https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). However, any version from 2.3 and above should work for the majority of commands in this book.

I won't go through how to install tmux but will instead refer you to tmux's homepage at where you will find instructions on how to install it for your preferred operating system.
